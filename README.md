# next-isr-bug

This is a repository for bug reproduction in Next.js

The repository is originally hosted on my GitLab and then mirrored to GitHub.
Why on GitLab? I'm using my GitLab for everything and I also wanted to deploy
the application so we can see the issue.

[next-isr-bug.vmdevel.cz/](https://next-isr-bug.vmdevel.cz/)

The application is running on Kubernetes (k3s) self-hosted cluster on my Hetzner
Cloud account, I am using ARM-based virtual machines with Rocky Linux 9.
